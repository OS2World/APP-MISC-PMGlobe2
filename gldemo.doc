GLDEMO.RAM
""""""""""

This .RAM file should contain all the files necessary to generate
a 32-bit version of PMGlobe.  Some of the source files are considered
IBM Confidential and are not included in this package (these are
included in this package as dummy files, length 123 bytes, to keep MAKE
happy).  Others are included for demostration purposes only: please do
NOT circulate or distribute any generated .EXE files -- multiple
versions of PMGlobe would be a developer's nightmare!

All the files in this package are IBM Internal Use Only, and may not be
given to customers or competitors.

Some random notes:

* The MAKE file looks odd, because it can generate both 16-bit and
  32-bit .EXEs.  It probably doesn't need modification for your for
  system for 32-bit generation.

* The MAKE file generates a GLOBE32.EXE (or GLOBE.EXE for 16-bit).

* The BUILD.CMD contains an example of the correct MAKE command (for
  both 16 and 32 bit).

* 32-bit Object files have extension .O32

* DUALPATH.H allows the same source to be used for both 16-bit and
  32-bit versions.  It is required for both at present.

* A couple of test macros (xx.PMG) are included

* TEE.EXE is a pipe-splitter, included as used in the MAKE file
