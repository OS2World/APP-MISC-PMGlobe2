One source I've used is the "Austin Code Works".  They have a
long/lat data file that has approx 130K points and a US cities
data files that has approx 33K cities by long/lat along with a
6K point file of the US.  These files costs $30 & $35 each and
Austin code works can UPS overnight if necessary.  Their address
is:
    The Austin Code Works          Voice (512) 258-0785
    11100 Leafwood Lane            Fax   (512) 258-1342
    Austin, TX 78750-3464 USA
 
The only problem with the files is that they are in ASCII format
and contain some errors (line segments don't close).  I've used
them to develop a Windows based mapping program for network display.
While they suffice, you can get more detailed data sets from
the US Geological Service with up to 6 million points but, the draw time
for this many points is terrible if you don't cull out the segments
that are invisible at the current display resolution
