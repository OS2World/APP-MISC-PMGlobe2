PMGlobe: Internal IBM supplementary documentation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

PMGlobe comes in two versions: PMGLOBE.EXE (16-bit version) and
PMGLOBE2.EXE (32-bit version).  If you are running OS/2 1.x, you must
use the 16 bit version.  If you are running OS/2 2.x, then you can use
either, but the 32-bit version is recommended because it runs up to 3.7
times faster than the other.  The versions should be functionally
identical, except that the "About PMGlobe" help panel indicates which
version you are running.

In either case, only the one file is needed.  Follow the instructions
that came with your operating system for details on adding new programs
to your system.

PMGlobe macros can determine which version they are running under by
using the 'extract versionb' command.

The versions of PMGlobe are source-identical, so fair speed comparisons
are possible.  However, user interface issues now favour the 32-bit
version (as this is now available to non-IBM users though the EWS
(Employee-written-software) program).  16-bit users may seem some
interference with PM functions while the globe is being redrawn (for
example, resurfaced icons may not be redrawn immediately).

If you have any questions or suggestions not covered by the PMGlobe
documentation, please use the PMGLOBE FORUM on the IBMPC disk.
