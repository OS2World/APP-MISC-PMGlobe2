Sorry Mike, I do not know the cost of the database.
 
It was extensively used in a recent PBS show about the greenhouse
effect:  "After the Warming" by David Burke(?), probably produced by the
BBC.  In the form of a globe (orthographic view) they rotated it until
the spot of interest appeared.  They also wrapped the flat simple
cylindrical view onto a globe, and vice-versa, using modern TV graphics
techniques.
 
Although the original image was supposed to be cloudless, two clouds
were actually present, in SW Africa and NE Australia.  These have now
been deleted according to the producers of the data base.

I've sent you the file.  The columns are AREA, SEQUENCE, DRAWTYPE,
LONGITUDE, and LATITUDE.  The geographic points are divided, by no
particular methodology, between areas A and B.  Areas C, D and E were
"special" areas for the AS procedure that used this file.  Area C has
points to draw small circles near the north and south poles.  Area D
has points for drawing circles of longitude and latitude.  Area E has
coordinates for drawing an outline circle for a globe image.
 
       Area     Rows
 
         A      1384
         B      1310
         C        11
         D       606
         E       121
 
My source for this file was another AS demo package called WORMAP PACKAGE
from the ASDEMOS disk.  Alan Carpenter (CARPENA2 at ASICVM1) might know
the original source.  The WORMAP file had screen coordinates for graphing
a Mercator projection; I did sort of an "eyeball unprojection" to get
lon/lat coordinates; I also made a few corrections and additions.
 
The coordinates aren't particularly accurate or detailed - - they're okay
for global graphics demos, but DO NOT use them for business, travel or
defense purposes ;).
 
Regards,  Dean

Well, it's a small world .. after following a long and tortuous path
through the forums, I end up at WORMAP PACKAGE on ASTOOLS.  Add one
Alan Carpenter to my nickname list and !whoa! that name and userid
is already in your NAMES file...
 
So -- the question: I'm looking for a "usable" source of geographic
(read: world physical) data.  What was the source for the data in
WORMAP and derivatives?  Is it 'available'?

Subject: Cloudless Earth
 
The November 1990 issue of Sky & Telescope contains two "maps" of the
earth made from many NOAA weather satellite photos, but without any grid
or lettering.  The individual photos were selected for minimum cloud
cover and any remaining clouds removed pixel-by-pixel.  All areas are
shown with local summer except for mountains above 10000 feet which are
winter for snow cover.  The coloring appears natural:  green for
vegetation, tan for desert, white for snow and ice, and dark blue for
oceans and lakes.  Because they are photo based, shadings are natural,
for example silt laden water at the mouths of large rivers is clearly
visible.  The Arctic ice cap and oceanic islands are also visible.
 
The database contains 4000x8000 pixels (2.7'/pixel) (lat x lon), which
when displayed without modification forms a simple cylindrical projection
(pp480-1).  The coordinates are also converted to an orthographic
projection centered north of the Azores (cover).  The database will be
used to create GeoSpheres that are seven feet in diameter.  For info write:
