The UTM maps (6 degrees per side) could be called from a world map which
thus serves as an index map.  The Mercator is an example of a cylindrical
map projection, but the equirectangular is simpler, requiring only a
constant times the stored lon/lat coordinates (no transcendental
calculations), although all need some coordinate conversion in a zoom
application if the larger scales need to be accurate.
 
Because cylindrical projections display the poles as horizontal straight
lines, they have excessive distortion in the polar regions.  The list
below is in order of decreasing area distortion and increasing shape
distortion.  Both the Miller and the equirectangular achieve a balance.
 
In the formulas, R is the radius of the earth at the map scale and lon
and lat are in degrees.  The map center (x=0, y=0) is the intersection
of the central meridian lon0 and the equator.  The inverse formulas are
easily derived by isolating lon or lat, applying inverse transcendental
functions if necessary, like arctan for tan and exp for ln.
 
To fit the map into your screen or window, the aspect ratio, width/height,
can be controlled by N which is cos(lat1) where lat1 are the standard
parallels having true scale (Miller and Mercator have true scale at the
equator).  The Mercator's aspect ratio is determined by the maximum N &
S latitudes displayed, which can also control the aspect ratios of the
other projections.
 
Miller:
   Becomes the Mercator if N=1, but the area distortion is reduced and
   the poles can be shown if N<1.  Miller recommended N=.8
      x = (R*pi/180)*(lon - lon0)     y = R*ln(tan(N*lat/2 + 45))/N
 
Equirectangular:
   Less area distortion than the Miller at the expense of more shape
   distortion.  Becomes the simple cylindrical if N=1.
   Commonly used as an index map to other maps in a collection.
      x = (R*pi/180)*(lon - lon0)*N   y = (R*pi/180)*lat
 
Equal-Area:
   Used when areas must be in proper proportion, but then polar shapes
   become quite distorted, being compressed N-S and stretched E-W.
   The Peters also has noticeable N-S stretching of equatorial shapes.
   N: Lambert=1, Behrmann=.866, Edwards=.794, Peters=.707
      x = (R*pi/180)*(lon - lon0)*N   y = R*sin(lat)/N

 An excellent  discussion of map projections  occurs in recent  publications of
 the United States Geological Survey:
 
 USGS Professional Paper 1453:
    "An album of map projections", John P. Synder and Phillip M. Vosland, 1989
    Depicts 90 map projections (each almost page size), discusses their
    advantages and disadvantages, and gives forward equations from latitude
    and longitude on a sphere to x/y coordinates on a plane.
 USGS Professional Paper 1395:
    "Map projections--a working manual", John P. Snyder, 1987
    Discusses the more important projections, presents the forward and inverse
    equations from/to a sphere or an ellipsoid.
 USGS Bulletin 1629:
    "Computer-Assisted Map Projection Research", John P. Snyder, 1985
    Discusses efficient transfer of data from one projection to another using
    polynomial approximations, and minimizing the distortion of projections
    using least squares approximations.
 
 Also: "The World in Perspective", Frank Canters and Hugo Decleir, 1989
    68 world projections are discussed, depicted, and their equations are
    presented.  They are compared via several distortion parameters.
    No projection of the entire globe is completely satisfactory.
 
 The azimuthal (or zenithal) class of projections  is good for general use from
 the largest  scale quadrangles to  maps of a  hemisphere.  It  uses projection
 onto  a plane  tangent  to  the sphere  at  some point.    The  origin of  the
 rectangular coordinates on  the plane (x=0, y=0) corresponds to  the center of
 the map at (lat1,  lon0).  The following formulas place  no restriction on the
 map center, which  could be polar (lat1  = +/-90 degrees), equatorial  (lat1 =
 0), or oblique (lat1 somewhere in between).
 
 x = R K cos lat sin (lon - lon0)
 y = R K (cos lat1 sin lat - sin lat1 cos lat cos (lon - lon0))
 
   lat   north latitude (south minus)
   lon   east longitude (west minus)
   lat1  north latitude of central point (south minus)
   lon0  east longitude of central meridian (west minus) (applicable only
         between the north pole (top) and the south pole (below))
   R     radius of sphere at map scale
   K     scale factor perpendicular to radius from map center
 
   Y axis lies along the central meridian lon0, y increasing north
   X axis is perpendicular to Y axis at (lat1, lon0), x increasing east
 
   Vertical Perspective:  K = (P - 1)/(P - cos c)
   Orthographic:          K = 1
   Equidistant:           K = c/sin c        (K = 1 if c = 0)
   Equal-Area:            K = SQRT(2/(1 + cos c))
 
   cos c = sin lat1 sin lat + cos lat1 cos lat cos (lon - lon0)
      or for greater accuracy if c rather than cos c is needed:
   sin (c/2) = SQRT( (sin ((lat - lat1)/2))**2
                     + cos lat1 cos lat (sin ((lon - lon0)/2))**2 )
   c is the great circle distance from the map center in radians
 
 The  Vertical Perspective  is the  general view  of  the earth  from a  single
 perspective point.  P is the  perspective radius normalized to earth's radius,
 positive on the side of the tangential plane.  The radius of a spherical earth
 with the same  surface area as that of  the actual ellipsoid is 6371  km.  The
 outline maps on  photos from weather satellites  are a view of  the earth from
 geosynchronous orbit at a radius  of 42172 km,  P = 6.62, cos c > 1/P.  If the
 perspective is at  infinity then the Orthographic  projection results, causing
 the  planar image  to look  like a  true globe  to the  mind.   Here, for  one
 hemisphere, cos c > 0.  In both cases, do not limit cos c to get a transparent
 earth effect.  Two low distortion perspectives of a hemisphere or more are the
 La Hire,  P = -1.707, cos c > 0,  and the Clarke Twilight, P = -1.27,  c < 108
 degrees.
 
 If the perspective is  from the earth's surface opposite the  map center, then
 the Stereographic projection  results, which is conformal,  meaning the shapes
 and angles at every point are true (P = -1, cos c > 0).  If the perspective is
 from the center of the earth, then  the Gnomonic projection results, which has
 the unique  property that all straight  lines are great circles,  although its
 scale is severely distorted  (P = 0, cos c > 0).   Two related non-perspective
 projections are  the Azimuthal Equidistant, where  all distances from  the map
 center are true, and the Lambert Azimuthal  Equal-Area, where all areas are in
 proper proportion.  For low distortion, limit both of these to one hemisphere,
 cos c > 0.   Two hemispheres  side by  side is a  suitable  projection  of the
 world.  Of course, (x, y) limits  apply when displaying large scale maps whose
 spherical limits go way beyond the screen edges.
 
 The distortion caused  by displaying the resulting planar  map on conventional
 monitors  having slightly  spherical screens  is  substantial, so  ellipsoidal
 formulas can be safely ignored.   However, the ellipsoidal formulas are needed
 for driving  accurate plotters  at large scales  above  1:100 000, and improve
 accuracy  for scales  down to  1:5 000 000.  At smaller  scales,  the inherent
 sphere to plane distortion  is much greater.  The inverse  formulas are needed
 when the user points to a spot on the map with a cursor or mouse.
